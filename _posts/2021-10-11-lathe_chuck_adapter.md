let's see how this steel cutting adventure goes

this chuck adapter plate is already useless to me as is, can't make it worse :D

so these chucks I boought can't mount directly to my lathe spindle; i need an adapter

I bought an adapter for my larger chuck, but it's designed to mount to an even smaller lathe... but I have the chicken and egg problem of how to hold  a very large object precisely without a 4-jaw chuck, WHICH IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO MOUNT IN THE FIRST PLACE

I can clamp onto it from the inside, but only from one side

so I have the chuck adapter plate mounted into my original chuck backwards in a goofy way so I can bore out the inner diameter to make it holdable from the other direction, and then do the actual ops...

Huh cutting steel on the lathe so far seems to be a non-issue
