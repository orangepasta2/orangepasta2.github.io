saw a video on someone making a 6-sided die (as in a board game die) purely on the mini lathe, starting from round stock

so i already knew you could mount things in dumb directions in the chuck and use a lathe to make an arbitrary flat surface (with very exciting noises from your cutter; interrupted cuts abound!)

but what I didn't know is that a normal self-centering 3 jaw chuck can actually always hold square stock exactly parallel to lathe's axis of rotation (but not inline with it, but that's okay in this case since we're only working on the end face)

so as a test I stuck some 2020 extrusion with a really rough bandsaw cut on the end into the lathe. It aligns itself into the 3 jaws in a satisfying way. The center of the 2020 does not line up with the axis of rotation, but the center axis of the 2020 does revolve perfectly around the lathe's axis of rotation

got a nice cut on the end of the 2020 that visually looked perfectly square

I tested the squareness and it's squarer than I can measure with my precision blocks :D

so by being bored I accidentally found a much easier solution to a problem i've been having with trying to make square cuts

resulting cut

look where the center of the cut circles are

the center of the cut circles are perfectly horizontally centered, and the center of the cut circles are exactly in the center of the material between the middle hole and the bottom of the slot

surface finish isn't great cause it was a quick test and this makes a hell of a racket lmao, and it's too late at night to do serious machining

it also looks hilarious and terrifying when it spins
