when you upload SVG files to cut with the Shaper Origin, you can group them into 'projects'. The project can have name, description, photos, etc.

My first project with the tool is to make a permanent shaper tape table surface to use as a jig for cutting small objects. The top of the table is just a plain surface covered in rows of shaper tape.

So by sheer coincidence the default placeholder image for projects without
any photos is already a perfectly appropriate image for the project

look at this illegally smol endmill bit

Technically with that size you don't need any other endmill bits

micro endmill bit is universal bit
