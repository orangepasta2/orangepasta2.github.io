Cut mounting 4 temporary mounting holes and a center hole for visual reference, and engraved outline of oversized final circle

Cut out most of the non-circular stuff on the portable band saw

Holy, after all the cuts I'm pretty sure the piece was at least 200F

I still couldn't hold it for like 10 minutes after the cuts


I was wondering if I accidentally annealed or hardened it

I might have reached boundaries of those temps, but it needs hours it seems

the stock is absolutely not flat, so I couldn't just drill the holes to fill size and tap them, since the result would not be perpendicular to the final part

So the holes are undersized to temporarily bolt it into the lathe with smaller bolts to make both sides flat and parallel, then I can expand the mounting holes and properly tap them straight
